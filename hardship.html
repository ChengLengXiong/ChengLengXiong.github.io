			<p class="mart13">When Ka Ying was little they were poor. He had two older brother, but no sister. Since he had no sister in the house to help out with the chores, he had to start learning at a very young age. At the age of five, Ka Ying's parent took him to work on the grass field so that he can learn when he grow up. Every morning they would repeat the same thing where they get up early ot go work at the grass feild. At that time the war was happening so they had to stop their work and run from the war. Ka Ying and his family had to emigrate from Loas to Thailand to be safe from the war. The journey from Laos to Thailand was very long so they had to stop in the jungle to rest and to stay away from the enemies. They stayed with four to five others families so that they won't be afriad. ka Ying and his family were very sad when they saw their own kind of people's dead along the jungle walkway when they walk pass them. Staying in the jungle was very difficult for them because it is hard to find food and with a sound and view of enemies, it is life and death. After staying in the jungle for a few day, they manage to escape and came face to face with the Mekong River. It was said that the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mekong+river&rlz=1C1AVFC_enUS817US817&sxsrf=APq-WBt50TUZz2h20E_t4c9mB-wihnMr9w:1647048910477&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi24fGpt7_2AhWLCjQIHQuuA28Q_AUoAnoECAIQBA&biw=846&bih=746&dpr=1.25#imgrc=bXLDUTQLHVuGcM">Mekong River</a> is the river that split Laos and Thailand. Ka Ying and his family made successfully across the Mekong River and into Thailand. They stay there until 2005 and came to the USA.</p>
